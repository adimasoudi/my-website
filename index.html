        <h1>About Adi Masoudi</h1>
        <p>My name is Adi Masoudi, and I am a master's graduate in Physics with a focus on complex systems. I earned both my bachelor's and master's degrees from Isfahan University of Technology. I began my undergraduate studies in 2016, specializing in Physics, and later transitioned to graduate-level research in the field of complex systems physics.</p>
        
        <p>My studies in complex systems introduced me to a range of fascinating topics and analytical tools. Through my work on time series analysis, I gained proficiency in advanced techniques such as multiscale entropy, multifractal analysis, and functional data analysis. I also explored machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian process regression, clustering methods, and deep learning models.</p>
        
        <p>For my master's project, I utilized LSTM neural networks to predict time series data and employed multiscale sample entropy and multifractal analysis to evaluate complexity within the time series. Currently, I am collaborating with Dr. Pierluigi Vellucci on ordinal networks, an innovative approach to time series analysis.</p>
